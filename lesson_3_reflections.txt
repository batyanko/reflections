When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Accessing the repository from more than 1 device would normally require a remote repository. I would also maintain a remote repository as backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may often be discrepancies between the local and remote version of the repository.
